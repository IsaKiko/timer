Many plants survive times of drought in the form of seeds which often lie buried in the ground for several years and do not put out shoots before it rains. When that happens, the plants grow very quickly and form flowers and seeds, which in due time develop into the next generation. Some animals behave in a similar way. There are frogs that bury themselves in the ground and form a capsule which prevents them from drying out. These frogs only come to the surface when it finally rains. They use this time in which water is available to provide for their offspring. A lot of plants in the desert have adapted to the dryness in other ways. Some have extensive roots that take in water from a large area or reach into the ground very far.";
