The visual perception of colours is well developed in the case of birds, and among a lot of species the males wear a colourful outfit to please the females. Plants often have coloured flowers to attract insects, which help them to reproduce. Some animals that are poisonous or taste unpleasant wear striking colours as warning. Wasps, for instance, can easily be recognised by their yellow and black stripes, and birds learn quickly that they will be stung if they attack insects wearing these stripes. But not all colourful animals are poisonous. There are harmless flies that do not have a sting but imitate wasps. Other animals protect themselves by making themselves almost invisible. They look like the leaves, the ground of the rocks on which they live.";
