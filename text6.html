Some animals take recourse in camouflaging themselves, while others hide away. A number of them can fly away and others are so fast that they can flee from their enemies. Plants, which as is well known cannot run away, have developed other means to protect themselves. These include sharp spines and thorns or a tough skin. Other plants and also a number of animals protect themselves by poison that they contain. These poisons need not necessarily be deadly. It is sufficient if they prevent other animals from eating the poisonous beings. Some animals even protect themselves by looking like others that contain poisonous substances. In the animal kingdom, a particularly striking colour generally signals that the animal is inedible.";
