Its protection against the cold consists of a skin with thousands of single hairs and a thick layer of fat. With its big lungs it can easily stay under water for more than twenty minutes. The beaver is not only skilful in felling trees, but also an experienced craftsman in building dams. When the beaver fells a tree, it gnaws on the trunk in such a way that the upper and the lower part of the trunk are only connected with each other at a small point. When the connection is narrow and the beaver has become tired, the wind will do the rest. The twigs and thin branches are cut off by the beaver and piled up near its den, which is built on a small island. The thick branches are sorted out and used as wood for building dams.";
