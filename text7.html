Islands can come into existence when volcanoes rise from the floor of the sea or when the water level rises or falls. A number of islands came into existence at the end of the last ice age. As the ice melted, the water ran into the sea, whose level rose so much as a result of this that low lying land was flooded. Today only the highest points stick out of the sea as islands. Animals and plants that have managed to reach a remote island in some way normally cannot leave it anymore. If they want to stay alive, they have to adapt to the new environment very quickly. For living things that are native to islands, there is always a danger that they may become extinct when new animals arrive or human beings start to interfere.";
