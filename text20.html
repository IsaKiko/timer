He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers, and his tail was like a long bit of black rubber. The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water. â€˜You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,' she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done. But the little ducks paid no attention to her. They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all. 'What disobedient children!' cried the old Water-rat; 'they really deserve to be drowned.' 'Nothing of the kind,' answered the Duck, 'every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.'";
